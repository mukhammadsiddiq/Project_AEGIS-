# aegis.py:

Aim: To serve as the main entry point of the toolkit, integrating all the modules and providing a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the different security features.

# network_security.py:

Aim: To monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities. This helps in identifying potential security threats within the network.

# data_encryption.py:

Aim: To provide tools for encrypting and decrypting data, ensuring that sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access.

# vulnerability_scanning.py:

Aim: To scan networks and systems for potential security vulnerabilities, allowing users to identify and address weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.

# intrusion_detection.py:

Aim: To detect unauthorized access attempts and alert the user, helping to protect the system from intrusions and breaches.

# logging_reporting.py:

Aim: To log security-related activities and generate comprehensive reports. This aids in auditing, compliance, and understanding the security landscape of the monitored environment.
